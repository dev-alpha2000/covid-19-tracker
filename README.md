# COVID-19 Tracker

The project uses an api from 'https://covid19.mathdro.id/api' to render the total number of COVID19 cases globally as well
as in individual countries using Charts. The COVID-19 pandemic has struck the world fiercely so this is my small contribution to this cause. Hopefully somebody finds this project useful.

Thank You.
